<H1>Passive Scan Rules - Beta</H1>
The following beta quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>Cookie Without SameSite Attribute</H2>
This reports any cookies that do not have the SameSite attribute or that do not have a recognised valid value for that attribute.

<H2>Cross Domain Misconfiguration</H2>
Passively scan responses for Cross Domain MisConfigurations, which relax the Same Origin Policy in the web browser, for instance.<br>
The current implementation looks at excessively permissive CORS headers.

<H2>Information Disclosure: In URL</H2>
Attempts to identify the existence of sensitive details within the visited URIs themselves 
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Referrer</H2>
Identifies the existence of sensitive details within the the Referrer header field of HTTP requests
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Suspicious Comments</H2>
Analyzes web content to identify comments which contain potentially sensitive details. Which may lead to 
further attack or exposure of unintended data.

<H2>Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s)</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Powered-By details.

<H2>Servlet Parameter Pollution</H2>
Searches response content for HTML forms which fail to specify an action element. Version 3 of the 
Java Servlet spec calls for aggregation of query string and post data elements which may result in 
unintended handling of user controlled data. This may impact other frameworks and technologies as well.

<H2>Timestamp Disclosure</H2>
A timestamp was disclosed by the application/web server.

<H2>Username Hash Found</H2>
If any context contains defined users this scanner checks all responses for the presence of hashed values representing those usernames.
Discovery of any such value may represent an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. Alerts are only raised as informational items as further manual testing is required in order to confirm and assess impact.

<H2>X-AspNet-Version Response Header Scanner</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-AspNet-Version/X-AspNetMvc-Version details.

<H2>X-Debug-Token Information Leak</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Debug-Token and X-Debug-Token-Link details.
Which indicates the use/exposure of Symfony's Profiler. Symfony's Profiler provides access to a significant amount of information of interest to malicious individuals and Security Testers.
